* Implement a comparison with the distribution of distances
* Introduce more assertions and unit tests
* PersistentAttack (tries the same attack with different epsilons until it succeeds)
* Find a policy for failures in adversarial attacks
* Check custom filters for utils.Filter
* Check get_best_threshold
* Add support for test recipes? (such as files with test specifications)
* Handling parallel attacks requires quite a lot of considerations. Hide them from the user
* Implement logging
* get_adversarials returning a Filter is confusing
* Checking the correct classifications in get_adversarial_samples is sometimes redundant
* Complete setup.py
* Test when there are no successful adversarial samples
* Rename variables to encompass more than images?
* Complete load_pretrained_model
