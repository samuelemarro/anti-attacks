* Introduce more assertions and unit tests
* PersistentAttack (tries the same attack with different epsilons until it succeeds)
* Find a policy for failures in adversarial attacks
* Check custom filters for utils.Filter
* Check get_best_threshold
* Implement logging
* get_adversarials returning a Filter is confusing
* Checking the correct classifications in get_adversarial_samples is sometimes redundant
* Complete setup.py
* Complete differentiable_evasion
* Add ImageNet support
* Add loader overloading
